# üìä Data Analysis Pipeline: Video & Comment Analysis

## Overview

This project builds a full pipeline for analyzing **YouTube videos and comments**. The flow is:

1. Understand and clean raw data
2. Detect and filter spam comments
3. Preprocess videos and comments for NLP tasks
4. Perform relevance scoring and sentiment analysis
5. Categorize videos into meaningful groups

The workflow integrates classical preprocessing with modern transformer models for text classification, sentiment, and similarity tasks.

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning

Datasets:

- **Videos Table (videos.csv)**
- **Comments Table (comments.csv)** :5 datasets combined into one

Steps:

- Combined 5 comment datasets
- Checked columns, nulls, unique values
- Visualized numeric features
- Removed row duplicates by commentId & videoId
- Removed non-informative columns

  - Videos: `kind`, `favouriteCount` (always 0)
  - Comments: `kind`

- Data type correction:

  - Converted timestamps ‚Üí datetime
  - Converted IDs ‚Üí strings

- Handled null values:

  - Dropped null `textOriginal` comments
  - Removed videos with many nulls

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing (1)

#### **Videos**

- Extract Topic Categories from URLs
  - Use regex to grab anything after 'wiki/' from 'topicCategories' column.

  - Two new columns:
    - 'extracted_topicCategories': List of topics for each video
    - 'extracted_topicCategories_str': Comma-seperated string of topics for each video

  - Flatten and Count frequency of each Topic Category 
  - Define and Remove videos with Target Categories (Irrelevant Categories)
  - 'video_filtered': dataframe that contains only videos outside targe categories
  - Remove Videos with like count greater than view count

- Clean_text function performs preprocessing steps including:

  - Lowercasing
  - Expanding Contractions
  - Removing Mentions, Hashtags, Links, Emojis, Punctuation
  - Normalizing elongated words
  - Collapsing whitespace
  - Tokenizing
  - Removing Stopwords
  - Lemmatizing
 
- 'cleanedText': column created after applying Clean_text function to clean video titles
- Detected English titles (`langid`) ‚Üí `is_english` column
- Translated non-English titles using Google Translator

#### **Comments**

- Filter out irrelevant videos
- Convert 'publishedAt' -> Datetime
- Sort 'publishedAt' in ascending order
- Added `duplicatedFlag`: same authorId + same videoId + same textOriginal

- Clean_text function performs preprocessing steps including

  - Lowercasing
  - Expanding Contractions
  - Removing Mentions, Hashtags, Links, Emojis, Punctuation
  - Normalizing elongated words
  - Collapsing whitespace
  - Tokenizing
  - Removing Stopwords
  - Lemmatizing
 
- Tagged duplicated text (checked after cleaning)

- Duplicated text ‚Üí spam
- Regex rules for spam:

  - NaN text
  - Contains links
  - Very short (1‚Äì2 words)
  - Emoji-only
  - Emoji > words

#### Approaches:

**Flow 1 (Initial):**

- Used pretrained `prajjwal1/bert-tiny`
- Trained on 500,000 comments
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Predicted rest of dataset

**Flow 2 (Final, Semi-Supervised):**

- Manually labeled 6,000 comments (700 spam, 5,300 non-spam)
- Trained `bert-tiny` ‚Üí performance:

  - Accuracy: **0.888**
  - Precision: **0.908**
  - Recall: **0.589**
  - F1: **0.71**

- Iterative improvement:

  - Predicted 10,000 comments
  - Margin sampling (uncertain predictions)
  - Manually labeled 1,000 comments (3 rounds)
  - Retrained after each round

- Final model used to predict entire dataset

---

### 4. Data Preprocessing (2)

- Filtered dataset with **no spam comments**
- Detected English comments (`langid`)
- Filtered only English comments

Skipped steps (future improvement):

- **Translation** ‚Üí too slow, may distort sentiment, costly for large-scale
- **Spelling correction** ‚Üí slang/shortcuts too diverse, existing models (edit distance, noisy channel, grammar correction) failed

---

### 5. Similarity Scoring

- Merged videos with comments
- Used `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Computed similarity between video title and comment

---

### 6. Sentiment Analysis

#### Models used:

- **nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment**

  - Classified comments into: Negative, Neutral, Positive

- **VADER** (baseline)

- **TextBlob**

#### Aspect-Based Sentiment

- Used `pyabsa`
- Extracted subject-level sentiment from each comment

---

### 7. Video Categorization

- Vectorized video titles using `CountVectorizer`
- Tuned hyperparameters
- Applied **NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)**
- Extracted keywords per group
- Labeled group names
- Assigned each video to most relevant group

## üìå Notes & Limitations

- Translation step skipped (time, cost, risk of sentiment distortion)
- Spelling correction skipped (slang and evolving internet language)
- Lightweight models used (`bert-tiny`) due to hardware limits (RAM)

---

## üöÄ Future Work

- Apply contextual spelling correction with transformer-based models
